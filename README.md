## Deployment

This software requires the following tools to be installed:

### 1. Installing dependencies, creating user, folders and setting permissions

Execute the setup script with root permissions:

```shell
sudo scripts/setup/set-up-environment.sh
```

#### - Hostname configuration: sudo host

If you type `sudo` in the terminal and get the error message `sudo: unable to resolve host` it means there is an issue with the system's hostname configuration. To fix it:

1. Verify the current hostname of your system (for NewtCAM is `imx8mm-var-dart`):

```shell
hostname
```

2. Check if it exists on the /etc/hosts file:

```shell
nano /etc/hosts
```

3. Update Hostname (if necessary):

(For NewtCam) Add `imx8mm-var-dart` after `localhost`

### 2. Installing Motion

**Motion** is a configurable software that monitors video signals from different types of cameras and create videos and/or saves pictures of the activity. Motion is installed from the release deb files which provides a more recent version than the one available via apt.
The most recent versions can be downloaded here [Motion releases](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases).

**Raspberry Pi DiMON** (Architecture: armhf-pi / OS: bullseye)

> pi_bullseye_motion_x.x.x-x_armhf.deb

<ins>Current installed version: Motion 4.5.1</ins>

**Variscite NewtCam** (Architecture: arm64 / OS: bullseye)

> bullseye_motion_x.x.x-x_arm64.deb

<ins>Current installed version: Motion 4.7.0</ins>

After determining the deb file name appropriate for our distribution and platform we open up a terminal window and type (example for the <ins>RPi bullseye</ins>):

```bash
wget https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion/releases/download/release-x.x.x/pi_bullseye_motion_x.x.x-x_armhf.deb
```

Next, install the retrieved deb package. The gdebi tool will automatically retrieve any dependency packages.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
sudo gdebi pi_bullseye_motion_x.x.x-x_armhf.deb
```

**Dependecies issues** If you're having dependency issues and you're certain that all requirements are fulfilled, follow this tutorial to update the dependencies file and recompile the package [Package Dependencies](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=35136).

#### - Configuring Motion

1. Open Motion service file: `sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/motion.service`
2. Add the argument to the following line, with `<device-type>` being either `DiMON` or `NewtCAM`:

```
ExecStart=/usr/bin/motion -c /home/app4cam/app4cam-backend/motion/config/<device-type>/motion.conf
```

3. Reload systemd: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
4. Add `motion` user to `app4cam` user group so that they can change the motion config file: `sudo usermod -a -G app4cam motion`
5. If you use auto-deployment, add motion service start and stop scripts: `sudo /home/app4cam/app4cam-backend/scripts/setup/create-motion-scripts.sh`

The configuration are described in detail at https://motion-project.github.io/motion_config.html).

#### - Running Motion as service

Motion needs to be run as a service so that it automatically starts whenever the device is started.

1. Enable service: `sudo systemctl enable motion`
2. Start service: `sudo systemctl start motion`
3. Verify that the service is running: `sudo systemctl status motion`

During development, you may need to stop Motion: `sudo systemctl stop motion`

#### - "libcamerify" Motion

libcamerify is needed for libcamera support (used with the newer RPi cameras). In these specific cases we need to
libcamerify Motion as suggested [here](https://forum.arducam.com/t/getting-an-arducam-imx519-16mp-autofocus-working-with-motion/4248).

1. Make sure libcamera-tools are installed `sudo apt install libcamera-tools`

2. Modify the motion service `sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/motion.service` changing the ExecStart line to  
   `ExecStart=libcamerify /usr/bin/motion`

3. Save and close. Follow with:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl start motion.service
   ```

4. Disable the autofocus of the camera. For the 64MP Hawkeye, you need to remove the key `"rpi.af"` with its value in the file `/usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4/arducam_64mp.json` after backing it up:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4/arducam_64mp.json /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4/arducam_64mp.json.backup
   sudo nano /usr/share/libcamera/ipa/rpi/vc4/arducam_64mp.json
   ```

**IMPORTANT:** When using pivariety cameras (e.g. 64MP Hawkeye) do not update libcamera.

### 3. Setting up network behavior

#### - On Raspberry Pi

We want to configure the Raspberry Pi in a way that it will **connect to a previously configured Wifi** network when the Pi is in range of the router (Laboratory conditions) or **Automatically setup a Raspberry Pi access point** when a known wifi network is not in range (Field conditions). For this purpose we will use the script **Autohotspot** developed by RaspberryConnect.com.  
On a new terminal, run the setup script with root privileges:

```bash
wget https://github.com/RaspberryConnect/AutoHotspot-Installer/releases/download/v0.74/AutoHotspot-Setup.tar.xz
tar xf AutoHotspot-Setup.tar.xz
sudo Autohotspot/autohotspot-setup.sh
```

You will be presented with these options:

```bash
 1 = Install Autohotspot with eth0 access for Connected Devices
 2 = Install Autohotspot with No eth0 for connected devices
 3 = Install a Permanent Access Point with eth0 access for connected devices
 4 = Uninstall Autohotspot or permanent access point
 5 = Add a new wifi network to the Pi (SSID) or update the password for an existing one.
 6 = Autohotspot: Force to an access point or connect to WiFi network if a known SSID is in range
 7 = Change the access points SSID and password
 8 = Exit
```

We should go for **Option 2: Install Autohotspot with No eth0 for connected devices.**

Once installed and after a reboot the Raspberry Pi will connect to a router that has previously been connected to and is listed in `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`. If no router is in range then it will generate a WiFi access point. The Pi can use the eth0 connection and also be accessed from a device on the etho network.  
The default SSID of **App4Cam** and password of **0123456789** will be used.
Once a connection to the access point has been made you can access the Raspberry Pi via ssh & VNC.

```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.5
vnc: 10.0.0.5::5900
```

If no error messages was presented, just exit the script and reboot your device. The "network behavior" should be well configured.

You can then also remove the files:

```
rm -r Autohotspot
rm AutoHotspot-Setup.tar.xz
```

#### - On Variscite

1. Run **with root privileges** the script: `/home/app4cam/app4cam-backend/scripts/setup/variscite/setup-access-point.sh`
2. Verify that the connection is running: `nmcli connection show`
3. Check the Wi-Fi's broadcast IP address: `ifconfig`

### 4. Installing ExifTool

ExifTool is needed to add the device ID to the metadata of each shot file.

1. Download latest version from [website](https://exiftool.org/): `wget <download-url>`
2. Unpack the distribution file: `gzip -dc Image-ExifTool-<latest-number>.tar.gz | tar -xf -`
3. Change into directory: `cd Image-ExifTool-<latest-number>`
4. Prepare make file: `perl Makefile.PL`
5. Optionally, run tests to verify system compatibility: `make test`
6. Install for all users: `sudo make install`

### 5. Enabling user services and USB auto-mounting

Execute the setup script with root permissions:

```shell
sudo scripts/setup/set-up-user-services.sh
```

#### - Checking USB auto-mounting

Only perform this checks if you have enabled this functionality in the setup script before.

1. Make sure that there is no udev rule configured for USB auto-mounting. The OS images of Variscite devices may come with a preconfigured rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d/automount.rules` that needs to be commented out.
2. Log in as user: `su - app4cam`
3. Verify that the service is running: `systemctl --user status udiskie`
4. Logout: `exit`

### 6. Make sure automatic time synchronisaton is disabled

Verify the result line `NTP service` of running: `timedatectl`

If it is still active, run: `timedatectl set-ntp 0`

### 7. Installing Witty Pi 4 (Raspberry Pi only)

**Witty Pi** is a realtime clock (RTC) and power management **board** added to the Raspberry Pi. It also allows to define ON/OFF sequences. Currently we are suporting witty pi version 3 or 4.

For witty pi 4, run these two commands in the raspberry pi home directory:

```bash
wget http://www.uugear.com/repo/WittyPi4/install.sh
sudo sh install.sh
```

A more extensive tutorial can be found at https://www.uugear.com/product/witty-pi-4/.

**If using the Witty pi 3, after the above commands, run this script to make the device compatible with the HW:**  
`sudo /home/app4cam/app4cam-backend/scripts/setup/raspberry-pi/witty-pi/select-wittypi.sh`

### 8. Adding FTP access (Raspberry Pi only)

The FTP access can be used as an alternative way to download multiple files without the need to archive files.

1. Install FTP server: `sudo apt install vsftpd`
2. Modify the configuration: `sudo nano /etc/vsftpd.conf`

   Make sure the following settings are present, i.e. uncommented or added:

   ```
   anonymous_enable=NO
   local_enable=YES
   local_umask=022
   chroot_local_user=YES
   user_sub_token=$USER
   local_root=/home/app4cam/data
   allow_writeable_chroot=YES
   ```

3. Restart the server: `sudo systemctl restart vsftpd`

Now, you can connect via an FTP client with the device's IP address, port 21, the username created and the corresponding password.

### 9. Hardware Configuration (Quimesis interface board only)
